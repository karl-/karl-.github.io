## About Me

My name is Karl. I'm a software engineer currently living in Columbus, Ohio. I tend to work on 3D technologies and related fields (e.g., video game engines).

[Gabriel](https://www.sixbysevenstudio.com/) and I built [ProBuilder](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.probuilder@6.0/manual/index.html), which was acquired by Unity in 2017.
